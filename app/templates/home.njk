        <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Check if you can apply for a Laying Hens Housing for Health and Welfare Grant</h1>
        <p>Use this service to check:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>if you are eligible to apply for a grant for your project (takes about 20 minutes)</li>
          <li>how your project scores against the grant funding priorities (takes about 15 minutes if you have all the project details)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can apply</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">You can apply if you:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>are the registered keeper of 1,000 or more laying hens or pullets</li>
          <li>will do the grant-funded work in England</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What you can apply for</h2>
        <p>You can apply for up to {{ grantPercentage }}% of the estimated project costs of either:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>a veranda-only project, to add a veranda on to existing laying hen or pullet housing</li>
          <li>a comprehensive project, to refurbish or replace existing laying hen or pullet housing in line with the grant funding requirements</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As part of a comprehensive project for laying hens, you must also include a veranda if you have enough outside space. This must be at least either:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>4 metres wide along the length of the hen housing area</li>
          <li>30% of the indoor hen housing area footprint</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As part of a comprehensive project, you can apply for up to 25% of the estimated costs of buying and installing a solar PV system 
          which produces up to 5 kilowatts (kW) of power capacity per 1,000 birds. 
        </p>
        <p>You must submit a separate application for each building if you are applying for grant funding for multiple buildings. You cannot 
          apply for both comprehensive and veranda-only projects.
        </p>
        <p>The maximum total grant amount each business can apply for is £500,000 for comprehensive projects or £100,000 for veranda-only projects.</p>
        <p>The minimum grant is £15,000 ({{ grantPercentage }}% of £37,500) for comprehensive projects or £5,000 ({{ grantPercentage }}% of £12,500) 
          for veranda-only projects.
        </p>
        <p>The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) will award the veranda-only grant funding on a first come, first served basis.</p>
